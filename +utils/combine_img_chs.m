function [img_out, cmaps] = combine_img_chs(img)
%combine_img_chs - Combine multichannel images to a truecolour RGB image
%
%   IMG_out = combine_img_chs(IMG) combines the MxNxCxP image IMG into a
%   MxNx3xP truecolour RGB image in the range [0, 1].  MxN are the
%   dimensions of the image(s), C is the number of channels, and P the
%   number of images.
%
%   This function currently supports images with up to 4 channels, and is
%   designed solely for display (rather than analysis) purposes.
%
%   Depending on the number of input channels, the following colours will
%   be used in the output image, in this order:
%   1 ch: monochrome (black and white)
%   2 ch: green and red
%   3 ch: blue, green and red
%   4 ch: blue, green, red, magenta
%
%   [IMG_out, cmaps] = combine_img_chs(IMG) also returns the 8 bit
%   colourmaps used for each of the channels.  The size of cmaps is
%   256x3xC.
