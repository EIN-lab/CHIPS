function ch_calc_ratio(self, chNums, varargin)
%ch_calc_ratio - Calculate the ratio of two image channels
%
%   ch_calc_ratio(OBJ, CH_NUMS) calculates a new channel based on the ratio
%   of two existing image channels, and merges it into the existing image
%   data. CH_NUMS must be a length 2 vector specifying the image channels
%   to use when calculating the ratio, and the new channel is calculated
%   based on the formula CH_NUMS(1)./CH_NUMS(2). For example:
%
%       ch_calc_ratio(OBJ, [2 1]) divides channel 2 by channel 1, and
%       ch_calc_ratio(OBJ, [4 2]) divides channel 4 by channel 2.
%
%   The resulting image data is converted to a double precision array to
%   ensure that there is sufficient precision to store the result.
%
%   ch_calc_ratio(OBJ, CH_NUMS, CH_NAME) specifies the name of the new
%   image channel.  CH_NAME must be a single row character array specifying
%   a valid channel name (i.e. one that is known to the Metadata class).
%
%   Please see the <a href="matlab:web(fullfile(utils.CHIPS_rootdir, 'doc', 'html', 'id_pp_utilities.html'))">pre-processing utilities quick start guide</a> for 
%   additional documentation and examples.
