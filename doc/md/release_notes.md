Release Notes
=======================================

<h2>v1.0.4 - First Public Release</h2>

**Known Issues**

   + Bio-Formats in MATLAB R2013a: The current Bio-Formats Java library is not compatible with the Java version included with MATLAB R2013a.  Please refer to the [system requirements](system_requirements.html) page for the workaround.
   + 5D images: CHIPS does not currently support images with multiple slices in both space and time.  In other words, CHIPS supports z-stack images, or repeated time series images (i.e. movies), but not a mix of both.
   + Non-square pixels: CHIPS is not currently designed to process images with unequal pixel aspect ratios (i.e. non-square pixels).
   + `repmat` with objects: There can be some unexpected behaviour in older MATLAB versions when using the function `repmat` with certain CHIPS classes.  For example, in R2013a, `scimArray = repmat(SCIM_TIF(), 1, 3)` does not behave as expected, but the alternative `scimArray(1:3) = SCIM_TIF()` does.
   + Tests: There are several compatability issues when running the tests. Please contact the developers for more information.
